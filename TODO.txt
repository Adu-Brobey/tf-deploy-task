- Infrastructure testing
- Disaster recovery plan

### 5. Cost Optimization:
- Right-size instances
- Implement auto-scaling
- Use reserved instances for production
- Budget alerts

## Priority Order:
1. Remote state backend
2. Load Balancer + Auto Scaling
3. Private subnets + NAT
4. Monitoring setup
5. CI/CD pipeline
